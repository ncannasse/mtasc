This document is dedicated to people who want to compile MTASC from sources.

Quick Guide :
-------------

- install OCaml (at http://caml.inria.fr ). 3.08 is recommanded
- install CVS (http://www.cvshome.org)
- download and compile ZLIB (http://www.zlib.org)
- put the "install.ml" MTASC install script into a directory of your choice
- configure ocaml and cvs so it can run from commandline
- edit and *configure* install.ml (see below)
- run the following command "ocaml install.ml" to run install script

Configuration
-------------

install.ml is an install script that will download and compile sources.
It needs some minimal configuration in order to work correctly.

First you need to choose which of the two build you want to compile :
- native : native is compiled for your processor, it will run a lot faster
- bytecode : ocaml bytecode program, however it is not platform independant
  since it links some C code for ZLib bindings

Then you need to configure the path where zlib.lib or zlib.a can be found.
For example on Linux you will have to replace it by something like :
	let zlib = "/usr/lib/libz.a"
