MTASC is very stable right now, so the releases since
version 1.11 are focused on minor fixes and enhancements.
Some people asked about the Future of MTASC, related to
the next version of Flash 8.5 player and ActionScript 3.

MTASC will not support AS3, as we are currently working on
a new and powerful language name haXe that will support
Flash Players 6-7-8 and 8.5 as well as Javascript and
Server-Side scripting.

You can check about it on http://haxe.org
